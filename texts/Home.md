Nowadays, traveling on airplanes have become more and more common. However, to many people, choosing the right airline and flight is a huge problem. Passengers usually get annoyed and frustrated due to delays and cancellations of flights. In order to help passengers that travels across the United States, we will use a dataset provided by the US Department of Transportation to show people which airline they should fly to avoid significant delays
