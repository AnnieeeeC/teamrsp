### Introduction

Nowadays, traveling on airplanes have become more and more common. However, to many people, choosing the right airline and flight is a huge problem. Passengers usually get annoyed and frustrated due to delays and cancellations of flights. In order to help passengers that travels across the United States, we will use a dataset provided by the US Department of Transportation to show people which airline they should fly to avoid significant delays

### Summary

The Map tab contains a map that shows the flight information from the dataset. The Report tab contains several interactive graphs that allow users to filter data in order to compare and choose the most suitable airline for their flight.

### Just so you know

The original dataset provided by the US Department of Transportation is too large (192.26 MB). Due to technical difficulties, we chose 1000 flight information from the dataset randomly.
