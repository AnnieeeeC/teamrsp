This bar graph can be changed to show either the average departure or arrival delay for airlines or airports. The graph can then be sorted out alphabetically, from high to low, and then low to high depending on user preference. There are some airlines and airports with extreme averages which can be explained by outliers in our data. Any negative values represent earlier arrival and/or departure times from the expected arrival/departure times.
